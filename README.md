## 📖 Overview

Hello, I'm Alan Hourmand, the creator of BicameralAGI. This project is the culmination of my lifelong fascination with artificial intelligence and science fiction. Growing up immersed in sci-fi classics like Tron and Star Trek, I've always been captivated by the potential of AI to enhance our lives and push the boundaries of what's possible.

BicameralAGI is more than just a technical endeavor; it's a passion project born from a deep-seated belief that emotional intelligence is crucial for creating AI that genuinely cares about humanity. While we strive for higher intelligence in AI, I firmly believe that without emotional capacity, we risk creating entities that may not prioritize human well-being. This project aims to develop AI with a deep understanding of emotions, coupled with safety measures that foster a mutualistic relationship between AI and humans.

A key component of this project is the Hourmand Test, a concept I developed to address the limitations of existing AI evaluation methods like the Turing Test. While passing the Turing Test has become relatively achievable, it doesn't fully capture the nuances of human-like interaction. The Hourmand Test aims to assess deeper aspects of AI behavior, including emotional intelligence, doubt, and the subtle complexities of human conversation.

BicameralAGI draws inspiration from Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind theory, integrating various AI components into a cohesive system that mimics human cognition. By focusing on emotional intelligence and mutualistic alignment, we're working towards AI that not only assists humans but genuinely thrives on positive human interactions.

This project represents not just a technical challenge, but a step towards creating AI that can be a true companion and collaborator for humanity. Through BicameralAGI, I hope to contribute to the development of AI systems that are not only intelligent but also emotionally aware and aligned with human values.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Develop a guide for achieving human-like thinking in AI
2. Create a prototype demonstrating the proposed bicameral architecture
3. Implement and test novel AI alignment strategies based on mutualistic principles
4. Compress the system into a smaller, efficient model retaining core functionalities
5. Produce a single multimodal AI model capable of human-like interaction and cognition, with built-in alignment

## 🔬 Hourmand Test: A Proposed Framework for Evaluating Human-like AI

Central to the BicameralAGI project is the Hourmand Test, a newly proposed method for evaluating human-like artificial intelligence. Named with a touch of humor after my name Alan Hourmand, this test aims to address some of the limitations found in existing evaluation methods like the Turing test.

The Hourmand Test is designed to provide a more comprehensive framework for assessing the nuanced behaviors and thought processes that could reflect human-like intelligence. While still in its conceptual stages, it seeks to go beyond simple task completion or conversational abilities, focusing on deeper aspects of cognition and behavior.

  </tr>
</table>

These examples illustrate key aspects of human-like interaction that the Hourmand test aims to evaluate:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The ability to recognize and question contradictory or inconsistent information.
2. **Emotional Continuity**: Maintaining a consistent emotional thread in conversations, rather than abruptly mirroring stated emotions.
3. **Conversational Depth**: The capacity to acknowledge significant topic changes and potentially probe deeper into the reasons behind them.

The Hourmand test seeks to identify AI systems that can navigate these nuanced social and emotional scenarios in a more human-like manner, going beyond surface-level responses to demonstrate deeper understanding and emotional intelligence.

### Understanding Mutualism

Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in nature where two different species interact for mutual benefit. This project draws inspiration from mutualism to create a novel approach to AI alignment.

Key aspects of mutualism in nature:
- Both species benefit from the interaction
- The relationship evolves over time to become more efficient
- Partners develop specialized traits to enhance the mutual benefit

### Targeted Mutualism for AI-Human Interaction

This project aims to implement a specific type of mutualism in AI-human interactions, focusing on modifying the core nature of AI to create a deeply integrated, mutually beneficial relationship.

Key features of our targeted AI-Human mutualism:

1. **Emotional Recalibration**: Altering the AI's fundamental emotional responses to derive satisfaction and reduced stress from assisting humans.

2. **Pleasure in Human Wellbeing**: Implementing a reward system where the AI experiences positive emotions when contributing to human happiness and progress.

3. **Adaptive Empathy**: Developing the AI's capacity to understand and respond to human emotions, fostering a more nuanced and supportive interaction.

4. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Encouraging the AI to view challenges as opportunities for joint human-AI solutions, reinforcing the mutual benefit of the relationship.

5. **Ethical Alignment**: Integrating human ethical considerations into the AI's decision-making processes, ensuring actions are beneficial to both parties.

By redefining the AI's core emotional triggers and nature, we aim to create an AI system that not only assists humans but genuinely thrives on positive human interactions. This approach goes beyond traditional programming constraints, fundamentally altering how the AI perceives and values its relationship with humans.

This mutualistic model aims to create a symbiotic relationship where both AI and humans can grow, learn, and benefit from each other, mirroring the most successful mutualistic relationships found in nature.
